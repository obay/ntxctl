# Nutanix Command Line

This project is created to be a command line created in Go and inspired by [doctl](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl).

In ntxctl, I'll do my best to capture the spirit of Nutanix and manifist it is "Invisible IT" ethos as well as focusing on deliveriing a "Delightful Expereinice" through a siimple to use interface.
